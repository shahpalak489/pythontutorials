REDIS

problem faced::

1) specially i faced problem while using jsonify dataframe or list data while sending back the response to the client
because decimal and dates are not json serializable so in the starting time it gives me erroe then 
i realized to change the datatype of that columns so that problem will not come

2) Working with Exceptions
Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line. If an error is encountered on a line, further execution of the code stops. However, you can handle known exceptions in Python using the try-except block. Letâ€™s look at a simple example, by generating a runtime error of dividing by 0:

x = 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
When the interpreter reaches this line, your program execution stops completely! However, using the try-except block can help avoiding the same.

try:
     x = 1/0
 except:
     print "Some error occurred"

Some error occurred
When such an error occurs within the try block, the interpreter just executes the except block. The except block can further be extended by catching individual errors:

 try:
    x = 1/0
 except ZeroDivisionError:
     print "You tried to divide by zero"
 except:
     print "Some unknown error occurred"

You tried to divide by zero
You can go one step ahead, catch the exception and further process it (like log the error somewhere) by modifying the except block:

try:
    x = 1/0
except Exception as e:
     print "Exception occurred: " + str(e)
Exception occurred: integer division or modulo by zero


3)Not being type-safe is my biggest concern in large applications and slows me down.
